# Docker for Fun and Profit
### A Kel Cecil Talk Experience

## What on earth is this?

This is the presentation (PDF with presenter notes) and primary example (app, Dockerfile, and docker-compose YAML file included) used in my talk at Pittsburgh TechFest 2015 entitled "Docker for Fun and Profit".

## What can I do with it?

Check out the presentation and follow along with the examples. Try modifying, building, and running the Chucksay Docker container! Challenge yourself to containerize all of the things!

## What do I do if I have questions?

Feel free to hit me up on Twitter @praisechaos if you have any questions or want to talk more about containers or other stuff. You can also check out my blog at http://kelcecil.com.

## Finally...

Don't miss Pittsburgh TechFest 2016 unless you like missing amazing conferences. Seriously. Don't miss it. Keep an eye on http://pghtechfest.com, or follow @thepghtechfest on Twitter to stay informed!

Have an excellent day, and keep learning!
